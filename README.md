Hello Fellow SuhDooMafio's'as

Just here letting y'all know that i am interested in learning programming and wondering whether this is practical place to begin learning it instead of C++ or other "language" I really don't even understand what that means just yet. I just know there are 
different ways to code and languages used. so being proficient in a commonly used languager seems to be the most desirable
AKA (hireable) $$ :) approach to learning a new skill to put in the old brain bucket. mostl filled with useless knowledge of lude
behavior. horrible scenario's/fantasy's, Movie Lines, Video game lingo, text acronyms, etc. side note
    I wonder how much potential knowledge/skillsets have i missed out on by getting sucked into mass media marketing, and brain
    numbing schemes to keep the masses. young dumb and full of .. yum?! haha gotcha!. your just as dirty as i am. yes i do love
    Toungue punching the ol' fart box so to speak. And she's grown fond of it as well, because well face it, she didn't have a 
    choice, either learn to enjoy it. or just be weirded out all the time. by his unnattural fixation on the chocolate starfish.
    P.S. Welcome to just a hint of the .... I don't think there is even a word fit to describe the atmosphere that is my brain.
